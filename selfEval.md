# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

I'd say I am fairly confident, but need to sit and think about the logic of each challenge a bit. I had to google a "even/odd" if statement to figure out code challenge 1 and 2. Maybe I missed it, but I don't remember anything about the "==" equal condition and how you can use it with the "%" to divide a number testing if the remainder is 0 or not.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

Pretty confident overall after these challenges.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

I am pretty good on these now and they are highly logical in how they work.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

About 1.5 - 2 hours so this one took me longer than others but had a lot of problems to solve. I also like playing with the code to make sure I comprehend what is going on and what changes do to the results.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I am hoping that what I learned here will help me solve the problems in the "for statement" CFU as I was totally stumped yesterday. I think I am good on these conditionals though.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

Can't think of any I wasn't able to find the answer to.
